# Locker App

This project is a entity locker implementation. The goal of this projets is create a class to work as a row-level database lock.

For lock entities was used ReentrantLock with a ConcurrentHashMap, when a entity is locked (by id). For each entity the entity locker will create a ReentrantLock to control locked entities.

For global lock, was create a global ReentrantLock when this lock is adquired all new entities will get the same global lock, so each new entity will be locked until unlock everything.

In case of escalation, was created a class EscalationEntityLocker, this class is a inheritance from EntityLocker, the diferente is EscalationEntityLocker have a escaltion detecter, this away the developer can control how many entities each thread can lead without lock everything.
